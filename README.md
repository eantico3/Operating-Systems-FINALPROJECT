# Operating-Systems-FINALPROJECT

To be completed by December 8th.

As a final project, we will be using the FileSystem Interface (API) to develop a program that is a limited version of ls but does ls -R by default. that takes arguments from the command line that includes a set of flags such as -l, -a, -f, and -d that prints only the directory. Use getopt to parse the arguments rather than manually doing it. This is a useful function for writing small, professional looking programs

Your program should have at least one usage function that prints the a line showing the syntax of the program and then a list of arguments and how they modify the function of the program.
